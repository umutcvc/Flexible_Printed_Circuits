# Flexible Printed Circuits;
Here is the proposal of workflow to fabricate flexible circuits. What makes the difference in this workflow from the other printed circuits is that a simple SLA/LCD printer is used to mask the circuit traces. From beginning to end, this workflow takes 45-60 min to finish a circuit.

Bill of Materials (BOM);
- Pyralux (recommended)
- Laminator
- Photosensitive film (double side protective layer)
- LCD based SLA machine
- Sodium Carbonate
- Ferric Chloride
